        Gemini, real, vulnerable—February is all about the deeply personal matters of life as the Sun passes through your zone of sexuality, finance, & personal growth for most of the month. Cancers may feel the need to retreat back into their shells as deep, unresolved feelings bubble up to the surface, asking you to face them. It’s like you’re getting stripped to the core, shedding the superficial and seeing your true self—no filters, no expectations, no societal pressures. For Cancers, this month is the astrological equivalent of “belting Christina Aguilera’s Beautiful at the top of your lungs in the shower” (a classic anthem off her Stripped album!)

        The skeletons that come tumbling out now are all about your personal power—areas of life where you’ve lost control and taken a backseat to other people’s opinions. This could be issues of financial security, sexual confidence, or self-destructive habits. Take heart that these sensitive subjects are being brought up to heal. With the Sun’s support, you’ll be able to take major steps towards self-mastery and unlock new levels of personal growth.
