Breakthroughs in this area might come during the first week of February, as Venus brings supportive energies to your friendship sector that help you feel <em>good</em> about where you‚Äôre currently at.

The universe is actively cheering you on in being the best you can be!</p><p>You can also look forward to more breakthroughs with friends as Mars enters your friendship zone on February 16, motivating you to take bold, decisive action. It aligns with the South Node of Karma on February 25, helping you to confidently release any blockers that are getting in the way of fulfilling relationships.</p><p>The end of the month brings the chance to revisit your communication style and how that aligns with your identity. Embrace the chance for a fresh start Pisces!</p></div></section></main><section class="forecast-signup" style="background: #c8fbf9;"><p class="mailchimp-title">Be the first to know when April 2020 horoscopes drop!</p><a href="http://eepurl.com/gTMshz" class="free-download">GET NOTIFIED</a><!-- Begin Mailchimp Signup Form --><!--End mc_embed_signup--></section><script src="javascripts/app-fb7a6e43261dc839321b.js"></script></body></html>
