This month is all about reconnecting with the tribe that can help push your vision to the next level.</p><p>Mercury is currently in retrograde and on March 4, it rolls back into your zone of friendships & community. As the astrological pause button, retrogrades force us to take a step back and reexamine our lives: who are your true friends and are you getting the emotional support you need? This is a call to reexamine your relationships and reflect on how you can be a better friend. Retrogrades also resurface the past and this is a time that can bring unexpected phone calls, random texts, and chance encounters with long-lost friends. It can also bring back past beef or conflicts, but this is an opportunity to find new solutions to old problems!</p><p>On March 4, Venus enters your zone of goals & money. For the next few weeks, you‚Äôre more cooperative in these areas and this is a great time to set up a collab or start a group project. How can you involve your friends or find a partner? March 8 may bring a surprising opportunity to collaborate on an exciting new idea.</p><p>The Full Moon on March 9 is a perfect time to take a break and refocus on your health and well-being. Sweat out the bad vibes through your favorite sport or exercise! Mercury also turns direct that day, helping us all feel less foggy and confused.</p><p>The last half of the month is all about you, Aries, as the universe starts shifting into your sign! The Sun enters Aries on March 19 and the New Moon follows on March 24.

This is a time when you become more serious about your friends. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you start to question who you associate with and how well you fit in. Unlike Mercury Retrograde which deals with the past, Saturn is all about how you can move forward. Perhaps you want to cut out frenemies & superficial friendships, or find a new circle that better aligns with your interests. Once you figure out what needs to be done, March 30 to May 12 are the best times to take action!</p><p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Saturn transits are critical in forecasting but they‚Äôre also long and complex, unfolding over months and years.

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to find you running all over town‚Äîsocializing, running errands, and making moves. This is a time when you can get especially busy with important documents and paperwork, but with Mercury in retrograde, things are bound to get confused or lost. You‚Äôre especially prone to hiccups now as Mercury is back-spinning through your communication zone. Make sure to double and triple check everything before hitting ‚Äúsend‚Äù!</p><p>The tempo has quickened since last month when Mars entered your zone of personal identity, lighting a fire under you. You‚Äôre especially motivated to go out and make things happen now, but again, Mercury Retrograde is hampering you. Hold off on making any big decisions or taking risks until Mercury goes direct on March 9. Until then, it‚Äôs best to go with the flow and not force things to happen.</p><p>Be aware that the retrograde may bring up communication issues between you and your romantic or business partners. Luckily, Venus enters your zone of dating & creativity on March 4, helping you be more cooperative in your romantic affairs. She‚Äôll help smooth out any conflicts brought up by Mercury Retrograde, and will even make you more attractive to potential suitors. This is also a great month for pursuing your creative endeavors, as Venus makes you much more artistic and visionary at this time. Go full-on with your blog, product, or side hustle!</p><p>March 8 is a lucky day that could bring exciting news about a long-held dream or goal. This may involve your romantic partners‚Äîit could even be that they want to take your relationship to the next level!</p><p>The Full Moon on March 9 is a call to remember the big picture, as you may have been too focused on the minutiae of life as of late. Sometimes, we fixate on our to-do list and forget <em>why</em> we‚Äôre doing them to begin with! It‚Äôll do you much good to leave behind your tasks (and troubles) for one day and let yourself roam free on a wild adventure, whether that means going far or sticking close to home.</p><p>As I mentioned, the best time for taking action will be <em>after</em> Mercury turns direct: March 10 to March 30. Within that period, the most splendid dates for success will fall on March 20 and 23, when Mars makes some intense alignments with Jupiter (abundance) and Pluto (power). Use these dates to do something <strong>big</strong> as carefully-planned risks are bound to pay off!</p><p>The most important event of the month falls on March 21 when your ruler Saturn makes a rare transit into your zone of money & values. Saturn is known as the zodiac‚Äôs disciplinarian and his influence is why you‚Äôre so serious and responsible, dear Capricorn. For the next few months, Saturn will make you get more serious about your income, finances, and self-worth. Consider this your new mantra: my net-worth is proportional to my self-worth. If you don‚Äôt believe in yourself, how can anyone else? The next few months will be challenging but rewarding as you work on building the confidence to go after your biggest dreams.</p><p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Saturn transits are critical in forecasting but they‚Äôre also long and complex, unfolding over months and years.

There‚Äôs a lot happening behind closed doors right now and I hope you‚Äôre making the best of Mercury Retrograde to address any old issues or blockers. This is the time to take a step back and reflect on the bigger picture, before deciding which direction to take. It might be hard to see where you‚Äôre going, but you should trust that your projects are going well‚Äîperhaps even better than you think! Allow yourself to relax and get a lot of rest as this will help inspire creative new ideas.</p><p>On March 4, Mercury Retrograde backslides into your zone of personal identity, upending your sense of self. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you start to question <em>everything</em>‚Äîyour image, your style, the way you express yourself and how you come across to others. Sounds stressful, but this is a perfect opportunity to reimagine yourself. How can you find and express your true authentic voice? Try taking a personality test or brush up on your birth chart!</p><p>Venus enters your home & family zone on March 4, helping you get excited about grounding into your roots. For the next few weeks, your domestic life sparkles and you thrive on caring for others. This will feel like relief, I‚Äôm sure, as your home & family life has been experiencing major changes since at least 2018. Have you moved recently or are you considering it? Venus will help you feel <em>good</em> about any big decisions that need to be made. Keep your eye on March 8 as you may encounter a surprising or unexpected situation at home, especially with a female family member.</p><p>The Full Moon on March 9 could bring a situation that might devolve into a conflict if you‚Äôre not careful, potentially around money. You‚Äôll need to work on the give-and-take and find a way to balance your needs against others. Mercury also turns direct that day, helping us all feel more clear-headed! You can finally move forward again on any plans that may have stalled during retrograde, and the next few days are ripe for manifesting. March 16 is an especially potent day as Mercury enters your zone of goals & money, helping you strategize for the future. This is a great time to reflect on your priorities: of course, money is important, but what are the things that make you feel truly abundant? Turn the attention on growing <em>yourself</em> and watch how the money naturally follows.</p><p>The astrological spotlight starts to shift into your communication zone as the Sun enters on March 19 and the New Moon follows on March 24. What have you learned during Mercury Retrograde and how do you want to share it?</p><p>Mark March 20, 23, and 31 as days when major moves can be made on dealing with mental health as Mars aligns with some planetary heavy-hitters in this zone.</p><p>Finally, get ready for liftoff as Saturn enters your sign on March 21. This is a <em>big</em> deal‚Äîthe last time Saturn was in Aquarius was 1993! After the fog of Mercury Retrograde, Saturn lifts the confusion and you‚Äôre finally able to see yourself clearly‚Äî<em>without</em> the opinions of others. By the time Saturn leaves Aquarius (in 2023!), you‚Äôll have found a brand-new identity and more realistic sense of self. Expect the next few months to be challenging but rewarding as you work on growing into your own skin, building up inner strength, and stepping forward as a leader.</p><p><em><strong>P.S.</strong> Saturn transits are critical in forecasting but they‚Äôre also long and complex, unfolding over months and years.

The Sun is passing through your sign for most of the month, bringing a spotlight to all things mystical, ethereal, and not of this world¬†‚òÅÔ∏è‚ú®</p><p>You‚Äôre bound to feel off and not quite like yourself as Mercury has been retrograding through your zone of personal identity. On March 4, Mercury will activate your zone of secrets & subconscious, making you feel <em>seen</em>. Don‚Äôt be surprised if you start to ruminate over old memories and regrets of the past, especially about what you <em>coulda, shoulda, woulda.</em> Healthy introspection is needed at this time to weed out the outdated habits and patterns of thinking that are no longer serving you. This is a more a quiet and introspective time of life, but it‚Äôs also a great opportunity to get in touch with your spiritual side. Do what Pisces does best and allow yourself to retreat from the world, making space for free writing, doodling, and daily reflection. Your subconscious is prime for downloading messages from the other side, especially through dreams. You can also gain major insight by studying psychology, using tools like astrology and Myers Briggs to unlock new depths of your own psyche.</p><p>One of the most important days for Pisces falls on March 8 when your ruler Neptune aligns with the Sun. This activates your greatest wishes & dreams and it‚Äôs an especially potent day for inspired ideas.

It‚Äôs all about sweeping the skeletons out of our closet and addressing the issues we‚Äôd rather not deal with.
